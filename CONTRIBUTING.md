## üìå What Contributions We Accept

Because `oboi-dlp` is security-focused software, we cannot accept direct code changes to the **core binary**.  
Instead, here are the best ways to contribute:

- **Community Tools & Integrations**  
  Build scripts, plugins, and wrappers that make it easier to use oboi-dlp with other software (e.g. Apache, Nginx, CI/CD tools, SIEMs).  
  - Post links in the [Discussions](../../discussions) or open a PR to add them to our **Community Integrations** section in the README.

- **Bug Reports**  
  If you find a bug, please [open an Issue](../../issues) with:  
  - Steps to reproduce  
  - Expected vs actual behavior  
  - Logs or screenshots (if safe to share)

- **Feature Requests**  
  Suggest features or improvements using the **Ideas** category in [Discussions](../../discussions).

- **Documentation Improvements**  
  Typos, clarifications, examples, and usage guides are always welcome.

## üö´ What Contributions We Cannot Accept

## üí° Best Practices for Contributors

- **Keep It Reproducible:** When sharing tools or configs, include simple installation or usage instructions.  
- **Be Respectful:** Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when engaging with others.
