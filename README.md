## ‚å®Ô∏è oboi&trade; Data Leakage Protection (DLP)

![Alt Text](oboi_logo_colour.png)

## üåü What is DLP - and what is oboi-dlp? 
**oboi-dlp;** is a DLP filter that protects your data from being leaked to third parties becuase of error, ommission or undetected vulnerabilities in your system. **oboi-dlp** installs as a Apache module that intelligently filters inbound and outbound payloads and blocks them from being served if they contain sensitive data. It also notifies you if exfiltration blocking has happened, then formats these notifications in to weekly audit reports that will import easily into your IMS (integrated Quality Management System) for compliance and quality reporting.

**oboi-dlp** has the ability to utilise TORIDION's TQNN FraudTagger scoreUsername API to detect POST payloads contaning email/usernames and validate against their enterprise fraud detection model at server level rather than code level. This added protection helps your web service/api/mobile apps flag or even block suspicious emails. Existing oboi licenses will be detected and used without further configuration!

<br /><br />

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

### **Step 1: Install the tap and oboi-dlp**
Run these commands in your terminal to install:

```bash
brew tap forshaws/homebrew-oboi-dlp
brew install oboi-dlp
```

### **Step 2: Enable oboi-dlp in Apache**

In Step 1, you installed the **oboi-dlp** software. Now, you simply need to enable it in Apache by finding your active ```httpd.conf``` file and adding the required lines.
<br />
<br />

**A: Locate your Apache installation**
<br />Run:

```bash
which httpd
```
or
```bash
apachectl -V | grep HTTPD_ROOT
```

This will tell you where Apache is installed.
<br />
<br />


**B: Find your active httpd.conf**
<br />Run:

```bash
apachectl -V | grep SERVER_CONFIG_FILE
```

For example, the output might be:
```ini
SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="/usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf"
```
You can open it directly with:
```bash
nano $(apachectl -V | grep SERVER_CONFIG_FILE | cut -d'"' -f2)
```



**C: Enable the required Apache modules**
<br />Inside httpd.conf, ensure this line is uncommented (remove the # if present):

```apache
LoadModule ext_filter_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_ext_filter.so
```
**note** the module path may differ from ```lib/httpd/modules/```. The important thing is to find the start of the line <br /> 
```#LoadModule ext_filter_module``` and uncomment it.
<br /><br />

**D: Add oboi-dlp configuration**
<br />Towards bottom of your ```httpd.conf```, add:


```ini
# OBOI-DLP Configuration

ExtFilterDefine dlpfilterin mode=input cmd="/usr/local/bin/oboi-dlp --mode=input" preservescontentlength
ExtFilterDefine dlpfilterout mode=output cmd="/usr/local/bin/oboi-dlp --mode=output" preservescontentlength


<Location "/">
    SetInputFilter dlpfilterin
    SetOutputFilter dlpfilterout
    
    # Export some request metadata for oboi-dlp
    SetEnvIf Request_URI ".*" DLP_URI=$0
    SetEnvIf Host ".*" DLP_HOST=$0
    
</Location>

#Uncomment the lines below if you want custom logs or ntfy support

#optional env variables to set a ntfy.sh topic. See https://docs.ntfy.sh/
#SetEnv OBOI_DLP_TOPIC "your_topic_name_here"

#optional env variables to set oboi log paths
#SetEnv OBOI_DLP_SYSTEMLOGPATH /usr/local/var/log/dlpfilter.log
#SetEnv OBOI_DLP_CAPALOGPATH /usr/local/var/log/capa.log

#set oboi-dlp API KEY (if purchased) See https://toridion.com/oboi-dlp for details
#SetEnv OBOI_DLP_APIKEY="YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"

```


Save the file and exit Nano.

**E: Configure the DLP Filter**
During install Homebrew will install a default ```oboi-dlp.conf``` file in your Homebrew‚Äôs etc path (normally ```/usr/local/etc``` or ```/opt/homebrew/etc```), not directly /etc. On startup oboi-dlp will find this file and load it. If it does not exist or is in not in the default directory then oboi-dlp will print a warning in the ```dlpfiler.log``` file.

You can check this log file by running"

```bash
tail -f /tmp/dlpfilter.log

```
Look for the log entry that looks like this that indicates a conf path error: 

```ini
2025-08-16T10:00:44+01:00 Config file not found, using defaults
```
The configuration file is a simple format :-

< KEYNAME > = < on/off >, < Threshold (int)>. Setting it ot off means that oboi-dlp will not test this filter.

The exceptions are ```Email Threshold``` and ```Whitelist URIs```.

Email Thresold is a INT setiing that controls how many emails oboi-dlp will allow to be served in one serve.

Whitelist URIs, is a comma separated list of endpoints that are excluded from oboi-dlp processing. ```whitelist.txt``` is included in the default setup to allow the oboi-dlp penetration testing scripts and tests to function. You can safely remove later.

```
API Key = on,0
AWS Key = on,0
AWS Temp Key = on,0
Credit Card = on,0
National ID = on,0
Sort Code = on,10
UK Bank Account = on,5
US Bank Account = on,5
Phone Number=on,10
Phone Number USA=on,10
Email Threshold = 5
Whitelist URIs = /status,/healthcheck,/whitelist.txt
```

```etc.install``` will put it in Homebrew‚Äôs etc path (normally ```/usr/local/etc``` or ```/opt/homebrew/etc```), not directly /etc.
Open the conf file by running: 

```bash
nano /opt/homebrew/etc/oboi-dlp.conf
```

or 

```bash
nano /usr/local/etc/oboi-dlp.conf
```

Edit the file if you wish, and save with ^O and exit ^X.

<br />


**F: System and CAPA Log Files:** oboi-dlp outputs critical evens like intrusions and attempts to access sensitive date in the ```capa.log``` and system related events in ```dlpfilter.log```. Initially these logs will be created in your ```/tmp``` folder. You can change this behaviour once you are happy that oboi-dlp is working as you expect. 

Due to the sheer number of ways sysadmins may want to use the logs, we left this up to the user. To make life easy for you, oboi-dlp looks for an environment variable for each of the logs.  For ```capa.log``` the env is ```OBOI_DLP_CAPALOGPATH```. For the ```dlpfilter.log``` the env is ```OBOI_DLP_SYSTEMLOGPATH```. The env paths are ideally set in the Apache ```httpd.conf``` (**see section D**) for details of that.
<br /><br />
For example, you can set the path to something like ```/usr/local/var/log/capa.log```. Just rememebr to update the permissisons so that oboi-dpl can access it. The ```httpd.conf``` extract below shows the ```capa.log``` enabled  by way of renoveing the # (Uncommenting the line)

```ini
#optional env variables to set oboi log paths
#SetEnv OBOI_DLP_SYSTEMLOGPATH /usr/local/var/log/dlpfilter.log
SetEnv OBOI_DLP_CAPALOGPATH /usr/local/var/log/capa.log
```

Similarly the CAPA log can be set toi a custom path using something like:
```bash
export OBOI_DLP_CAPALOGPATH=/var/log/capa.log 
```

Once oboi-is running you can look at the capa log using something like:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/capa.log
```

or in the latter case of a custom log 
```bash
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/capa.log
```

<br /><br />

**G: Enable NTFY notifications**
oboi-dlp is designed to work seamlessly with the popular ntfy.sh notification engine. All you need to do is tell oboi-dlp that you ahve a valid ```topic``` and it will automtically send critical alerts to that topic!

To enable NTFY  set your ```topic``` in the Apache ```httpd.conf``` (**see section D**) for details of accessing that. Uncomment the line and replace ```your_topic_name_here``` with the name of your ntfy topic. (The topic is yours, ideally it should be hard to guess and quite secret to you and our team)

```ini
#optional env variables to set a ntfy.sh topic
SetEnv OBOI_DLP_TOPIC "your_topic_name_here"

```

<br />

**H: Test and restart Apache**
Check your Apache configuration for syntax errors:


```bash
apachectl configtest
```
If there are no warnings, restart Apache to apply changes (your restart may be different):
```bash
sudo apachectl restart
```
<br /><br />
## **üõ† Test your setup**

oboi-dlp is invoked automatically by Apache when a file is served. If the oboi-dlp intelligent filter determine the data in the file to be sensitive it will simply block it outright and serve the message Access Blocked. A ```[CAPA]``` log entry will be added to you ```/tmp/cap.log``` or whatever log you have set. 



<br /><br />
## **üõ† Useful Apache Commands**

```bash
sudo apachectl status
```

<br /><br />

## üìß Usage Instructions 

oboi-dlp&trade; 

**Recommended : Adding your apikey to the env**

By adding the apikey to your environment variables you can activate oboi-dlp license. If your apikey is set in env, then oboi-dlp just uses your api credits.** If no key is set in env or on the command line it will default to free trial mode**. 

oboi-dlp recommend adding your license key in the httpd.conf (**see section D**), Buy a license key and then add it in place of ```YOU_API_KEY_GOES_HERE``` and uncomment the line (remove the #).

```ini
#set oboi-dlp API KEY (if purchased) See https://toridion.com/oboi-dlp for details
SetEnv OBOI_DLP_APIKEY="YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
```

Some Apache servers will see the standard env variables and you can add your key to the env the calssic way by using the following command **note we do not support you on this as there are too many things that can change. Use the method above for guaranteed success**:

```bash
export OBOI_DLP_APIKEY="YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
```

Remove the key using the following command:

```bash
unset OBOI_DLP_APIKEY
```





## üîê Free Usage & Fair Use

**oboi-dlp** trial mode is free to use under the license for personal, educational, and prototyping purposes.

Usage beyond this will require a valid API license key, please [view the API plans](https://toridion.com/oboi-dlp/) for license details for commercial use. Trial mode is automatic and trial activation will be completed when the install completes and Apache tries to access oboi-dlp for the first time. 

By installing oboi-dlp you agree to this and to the terms of the license.
